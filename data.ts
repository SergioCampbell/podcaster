        'Holiday album releases sometimes have a sense of pandering to them. "I\'m a pop star. Here\'s me singing the nineteen-millionth cover of \'Jingle Bell Rock.\' Please give me money."\n\n\nThe comedian and singer Matt Rogers understands this dichotomy of the holiday hit—part grotesque cash-grab, part unfathomably genuine cheer—better than anyone. His new album, Have You Heard of Christmas?, mines that tension for tragicomic gold.\n\n\n"Also It\'s Christmas," the album opener, announces this satirical spirit blithely, with an exhortation to "play this song seasonally!" "Rum Pum Pum" turns the little drummer\'s beat into a sexy club anthem: "Saw your name on the naughty list highlighted in red / Now you\'re up in the club in someone else\'s sweat." Over the course of Have You Heard..., Rogers poses questions that poke at the edges of Christmas lore: "Is it weird to hook up on Christmas day?" "How does it feel to be the hottest female in Whoville?" And, "Why does Santa needs so much lube for his sleigh?"\n\n\nMatt joined Nate and Charlie to share how his pop writing draws from sketch comedy rhythm, the influence he drew from both Ariana Grande and the Lonely Island, and how he accidentally created a sincere holiday hit in the middle of making a comedy album.\n\n\nSign up for the Switched On Pop Newsletter\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "Nicki Minaj is one of the most unique rappers of all time. She’s given us numerous iconic guest verses from “Monster” to “Flawless (Remix),” everlasting hits like “Super Bass” and “Starships,” and legions of loyal fans in the Barbz. She’s also given us over twenty alter-egos in the course of her career. However, no alter-ego of hers has been more impactful than Roman. The voice at the center of Nicki’s most unhinged music, the “Roman” persona serves a conduit for Nicki to put forward a high level of theatricality and character work in her music, from beats to bars. And to understand Nicki, you need to understand Roman. \nThis episode of Switched on Pop, producer Reanna Cruz takes us on a journey through the history of Roman, on the heels of Nicki Minaj’s latest record, Pink Friday 2. \n\nSign up for the Switched On Pop Newsletter\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nNicki Minaj – Chun-Li\n\nNicki Minaj – Red Ruby Da Sleeze\n\nNicki Minaj – Itty Bitty Piggy\n\nKanye West, Nicki Minaj, Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Bon Iver – Monster\n\nNicki Minaj – Roman In Moscow\n\nNicki Minaj – Pound the Alarm\n\nNicki Minaj – Starships\n\nLudacris, Nicki Minaj – My Chick Bad\n\nNicki Minaj, PTAF – Boss A** B**** (with PTAF) – Remix\n\nNicki Minaj, Eminem – Roman's Revenge\n\nNicki Minaj – Come On A Cone\n\nNicki Minaj – Beez In The Trap\n\nNicki Minaj – Roman Holiday\n\nEminem – The Way I Am\n\nEminem – My Name Is\n\nLil' Kim – Queen B****\n\nNicki Minaj, Drake, Lil Wayne – Truffle Butter\n\nTrey Songz, Nicki Minaj – Bottoms Up (feat.

        "Country music's had a massive year. Seriously, not since 1958 have we seen so many country tunes topping the Hot 100 in a single year – and it's not been without its share of controversy. Leading this country music revival? Morgan Wallen, for starters. He bounced back from being shunned for dropping a racial slur with his number one single “Last Night.” Then there's Jason Aldean with “Try That in a Small Town,” a song and music video that which unsubtly lynching references. Next up, newcomer Oliver Anthony Music dropped “Richmond North of Richmond,” weaving in QAnon references and welfare shaming into a track largely about government distrust. On a lighter but still contentious note, Luke Combs covered the mega 90s hit “Fast Car,” turning Tracy Chapman into the first black woman with a number one country hit. And let's not forget Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves' beautiful duet “I Remember Everything” about a past romance, which also climbed to the top. Many of these songs have just been nominated for Grammys, including “Last Night,” “Fast Car,” and “I Remember Everything.”\n\nWhen all this started happening, we were scratching our heads. Country songs topping the Hot 100? Sure, but not this many in quick succession. Something felt different. And we think we've finally figured it out after diving into Chris Molanphy's new book: Old Town Road. Chris, a music and charts critic, author of Slate’s Why Is This Song No. 1 column, and host of the excellent music podcast Hit Parade, explores country music's chart history in his latest book “Old Town Road,” part of Duke's Single Series. He zeroes in on Lil Nas X's 2018 “Old Town Road” and its 2019 Billy Ray Cyrus-amped remix as a case study. So, to get the lowdown on 2023's country chart toppers, we've got to rewind to 2018 and re-examine “Old Town Road” with Chris Molanphy's insights.\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\n\nLil Nas X - Old Town Road\n\nLil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus - Old Town Road remix\n\nMorgan Waller - Last Night\n\nJason Aldean - Try That In A Small Town\n\nOliver Anthony Music - Rich Men North of Richmond\n\nLuke Combs - Fast Car\n\nZach Bryan, Kacey Musgraves - I Remember Everything \n\nLil Nas X - Sonic Shit\n\nNine Inch Nails - 34 Ghosts IV\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus - Achy Breaky Heart\n\nLuke Bryan - Light It Up\n\nMorgan Wallen - Thinking’ Bout Me\n\nJason Aldean - Burnin’ It Down \n\nDeFord Bailey - Fox Chase\n\nCarter Family - Can The Circle Be Unbroken \n\nBill Monroe - Mule Skinner Blues \n\nHank Williams - Wealth Won’t Save Your Soul \n\nRay Charles - You Are My Sunshine\n\nPine Ridge Boys - You Are My Sunshine\n\nPatsy Cline - Crazy \n\nLionel Richie - Stuck On You \n\nBlano Brown - The Git Up \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'When Paul McCartney announced that he and Ringo Starr had produced a new Beatles song with the aid of AI, many music pundits were skeptical. Was this new song be another gimmick like the fake Drake hit "Heart on My Sleeve"? No. Instead, the Beatles simply used AI voice separation technology to repair a well-worn John Lennon demo tape. \n\nBack in the \'90s, Yoko Ono gave shared a collection of unfinished John Lennon demos with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison (who died in 2001) as part of a final recording session that resulted in the singles "Free As a Bird" and "Real Love." However, the third song, “Now And Then" was marred by hissing and humming, and the piano was overly loud. Harrison called it rubbish, and after a few hours of tracking a rough song they left it on the cutting room floor. \n\nBut now in 2023, using film maker Peter Jackson’s latest restoration technology created for his "Get Back" documentary, the Beatles were able to create one last song together, though in three different eras. Lennon tracked his vocals in the \'70s, Harrison\'s parts were lifted from the \'90s sessions, and McCartney and Starr added their parts in 2022. The band is filled out by a string arrangement by Giles Martin (Beatles cataloger and son of the late Beatles producer George Martin) and Ben Foster, in addition to reused backing vocals from earlier Beatles tracks. \n\nSo, did the Beatles successfully bring this worn-out recording back to life? Does this AI song sound like Beatles, let alone human?

        "It’s time for another edition of our series Chartbreakers, where we take a look at the trends and shakeups happening on the Billboard Hot 100. This week, however, the chart has been dominated by Drake and his album For All the Dogs, which takes up a grand total of 23 spots on the Hot 100. So, rather than do a story on that, Charlie and Nate take a look at the brand new TikTok Billboard Top 50 chart, established only last month.\n\nThis chart – which measures the most popular songs on the platform through each song’s number of videos, views, and user engagement – perhaps best shows the things that are popular and pervasive among a contingent of younger music listeners. Here, there’s room for everybody from Mitski to Sexyy Red to J. Dash, highlighting that the music that’s popular isn’t necessarily what hits the radio.\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\n\nDrake - First Person Shooter (feat. J.

        "Talking Head's concert film Stop Making Sense first came out forty years ago, and it’s just been rereleased in theaters in a 4k remaster by A24. The film finds the band — Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, David Byrne and Jerry Harrison — at the height of their powers over three successive nights at the the Hollywood Pantages Theater. As Chris and Tina remembered it when they spoke to producer Reanna Cruz, \"We'd reached a state in our career and our lives when we felt, 'we've gotten pretty good at this now. We can show the world.'\"\nDirector Jonathan Demme spliced the band's performances into an eighty-eight minute odyssey beginning with Byrne solo on the stage and gradually bringing in the rest of the band and a cast of stellar guest musicians: vocalists Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, percussionist Steve Scales, and guitarist Alex Weir. The film introduced landmark moments like Byrne’s big suit, Demme’s cinematic approach to concert cinematography, Chris's and Tina’s Tom Tom Club performing the perennial sample flip \"Genius of Love,\" and a theater-rocking version of \"Burning Down the House.\" Stop Making Sense broke the mold of concert films and created a new paradigm for artists to follow ever since.\nNate, Charlie, and Reanna take insights from Reanna's conversation with Tina and Chris on the legacy of Stop Making Sense as a guide to think through our own favorite concert movies — the Band's The Last Waltz, Madonna's Truth or Dare, and Beyonce's Homecoming — to identify the musical and visual choices that make them so indelible.\n\nSongs Discussed\nTalking Heads - This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) - Live\nTalking Heads - Burning Down the House - Live\nBeyoncé - Diva - Homecoming Live\nBeyoncé - Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) - Homecoming Live\nMadonna - Express Yourself\nMadonna - Live to Tell\nThe Band - The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down - Live\nThe Band - I Shall Be Released (Finale) - Live\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "The past two episodes of the show have been in Atlanta, and this week, we’re staying there with a look at singer-songwriter Faye Webster. Her music defies genre and convention: over the course of four albums, her sound has come to contain both pedal steel and indie rock as well as soft vocals and R&B sensibilities, all the while embodying the city of Atlanta. On this episode of Switched on Pop, we take a look at the work of Webster and how she builds her anomalous sound – even talking to the artist herself.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "Few producers have had such a demonstrated impact on the the last decade of music as Metro Boomin. Described by GQ as the “architect of Atlanta rap,” Metro has netted collaborations as far-ranging from Coldplay to Gucci Mane, garnered three #1 projects on the Billboard 200, and is credited with bolstering trap music’s presence both in and out of the South. From “Jumpman” to “Bad & Boujee” to “Creepin’,” we’ve been hearing his productions for years – all of which manage to capture the ear due to his penchant for eerie soundscapes and light and dark dichotomy. \n\nThis episode of Switched on Pop, we take a closer look at Metro Boomin’s career, highlighting what makes his production style so versatile. \n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nMetro Boomin, John Legend – On Time\n\nILOVEMAKONNEN, Drake – Tuesday (feat. Drake)\n\nFuture – Radical\n\nDrake, Future – Jumpman\n\nKanye West – Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\n\nBig Sean – Bounce Back\n\nMigos, Lil Uzi Vert – Bad and Boujee (feat.

Toby Keith's country smash and Jay Z, Kanye West and Frank Ocean's soulful hip hop anthem have little in common except a firm conviction that each song knows what it really means to be American.

        "In hip-hop, what draws us to an artist is not just the content of their lyrics but how they deliver them. Along with tapping your foot to the rhythm, understanding something called “flow” is essential to understanding hip-hop as a whole.\n\nIn this episode of Switched On Pop, we interview genre icon DJ Jazzy Jeff on the concept of flow: what it is, how it applies to all music – not just hip-hop – and how any rapper’s flow can be analyzed under his guidelines. Taking his word for it, we put our magnifying glasses on to look at the bars of our favorite rappers, from Megan thee Stallion to Babytron.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G. - Big Poppa\n\nMary J. Blige - Family Affair\n\nA Tribe Called Quest - The Hop\n\nDanger Mouse, Black Thought - Aquamarine\n\nBabyTron - Crocs & Wock’ \n\nRXKNephew - Take Three\n\nJID - Better Days (feat.

        'For the first time in 2023, a rap song is at number one on Billboard\'s Hot 100: Doja Cat\'s “Paint the Town Red.” It’s her second number one single after the disco inspired “Say So.” But the ubiquitous and lighthearted bop didn’t accurately reflect Doja’s divisive persona, an extremely online meme lord, and sometimes troll, with a history of riling up internet controversy. \n\nDoja Cat recently called out her fans for their parasocial obsessiveness, losing 250k instagram followers in the process. Simultaneously, religious conservatives have accused her of Satanism for her playful use of illuminati imagery at her 27th birthday bash. But rather than recoil, Doja Cat is clapping back at criticism by embracing the devil. \n\nOn “Paint the Town Red” she’s following the playbook of Lil Nas X’s “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” and Sam Smith and Kim Petras’ “Unholy,” all of which use demonic imagery to spark religious controversy while also commenting on artists’ indiscretions and the hellish nature of the attention economy. In her satanic suite — “Paint The Town Red,” “Demon,” and “Attention” — Doja Cat’s turns online flame wars into musical gold. \n\nMore\n\nListen to The Allusionist with Helen Zaltzman, the best and funniest podcast about language\n\nRead the history of the loon sample on Pitchfork by Philip Sherburne\n\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nDoja Cat - Paint The Town Red\n\nVanilla Ice - Ice Ice Baby\n\nLil Nas X - MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)\n\nSam Smith - Unholy (feat.

        "When Jimmy Buffett died on the first day of September, 2023, musicians from Paul McCartney to Pitbull mourned the death of the \"Margaritaville\" singer. This surprised Nate and Charlie, because frankly, they had never listened deeply to Buffett's work before, and viewed him more as a branding genius than a great musician. How wrong were your faithful podcast hosts. Jimmy Buffett was no novelty act or one-hit wonder. He found a precise combination of yearning lyrics, hip modulations, and singable melodies that produced a collection of songs that questioned the fantasy of Island Life as much as they celebrated it. Journey with us across the seas of Buffett's artistry as we listen for everything we might have missed about this unique musical icon.\nSongs Discussed\nJimmy Buffett - Margaritaville, Cheeseburger in Paradise, Why Don't We Get Drunk, Come Monday, Fins, A Pirate Looks at 40, My Gummie Just Kicked In\nHarry Belafonte - Will His Love Be Like His Rum?\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "In case you missed it, Beyoncé’s new album Renaissance is one of her most ambitious albums yet. On this week’s episode of Switched On Pop, we discuss Renaissance with beloved guest Sam Sanders, host of the new Vulture podcast Into It. In Sanders’ words: “it’s trying to do a lot” – but in the best way. The album incorporates seemingly every decade of contemporary popular dance music from Chic’s “Good Times” to Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy.”\n\nMuch of the early discourse surrounding the album was marred by a confusing controversy over a small sample (we try to resolve the issue musicologically) – but the references on Renaissance are worth listening closely to, acting as a guide through essential dance music. The album is an homage to the black and queer innovators of dance; with samples and interpolations of songs both niche and mainstream flying by, like a DJ set curated by house music pioneers. \n\nOn Renaissance, Beyoncé goes out of her way to cite, credit and compensate her influences, resulting in a triumph of musical curation. Just look at “Alien Superstar”: the song credits twenty-four people, largely due to Beyoncé’s musical nods, rather than an exercise in boardroom style songwriting. Sanders says “the liner notes themselves are showing you that this woman and her team have a PhD in music history.”\n\nListen to Switched On Pop to hear how Renaissance honors dance music innovators and finds new modes of expression in the genre. \n\nSubscribe to Into It with Sam Sanders\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3vE4jqf\nListen on Spotify: https://bit.ly/3bB7Vmf\nListen elsewhere: https://bit.ly/3BI0Nz0\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "Everyone seems to be getting Olivia Rodrigo wrong. She's one of the few pop stars who has made it big in the current era of fragmented music streaming, but so much of the narrative has been about whose songs she's stealing from, whether it be Taylor Swift, Elvis Costello or Paramore. Rodrigo's new album Guts arrives next Friday: while we wait patiently, we take a close listen to her new singles \"vampire\" and \"bad idea right?\" to subvert the narrative. These songs show that she isn't stealing from pop music, but rather uses a deep repertoire of musical predecessors to write very crafty music.\n\nSongs discussed:\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – vampire\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – bad idea right?\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – driver's license\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – brutal\n\nElvis Costello & The Attractions – Pump It Up\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – good 4 u\n\nParamore – Misery Business\n\nOlivia Rodrigo – deja vu\n\nTaylor Swift – Cruel Summer\n\nRadiohead – Creep\n\nScala & Kolacny Brothers – Creep\n\nLana del Rey – Get Free\n\nDavid Bowie – Space Oddity\n\nElvis Presley – That's When Your Heartaches Begin\n\nRoy Orbison – Oh, Pretty Woman\n\nTalking Heads – And She Was\n\nThe Breeders – Cannonball\n\nLiz Phair – Supernova\n\nWet Leg – Chaise Longue\n\nThe Beatles – Twist And Shout\n\nRage Against The Machine – Killing In The Name\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "In 2003, amidst a bunch of bleak alternative rock bangers like “Numb” by Linkin Park and “Bring Me To Life” by Evanescence, a rock song stood out on the charts for its fantastic hooks and juvenile sense of humor. “Stacy’s Mom” turned the New Jersey band Fountains of Wayne into MTV mainstays and Grammy nominees. But while they continued to release music, tour the country, and maintain a devoted fanbase, they never reached the same level of fame again.\nMost people never looked further than the raunchy music video, but Fountains of Wayne released six albums across two decades, each filled with tracks of quirky, clever, and undeniably catchy power pop. And the writer of that song, FOW bassist Adam Schlesinger, had a rich and fascinating career behind the scenes in film, TV, and more. In this episode of Switched on Pop, we explore the history of “Stacy’s Mom”, a perfectly crafted pop song that stands as a testament to the brilliance of a musician whose career was cut tragically short.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
